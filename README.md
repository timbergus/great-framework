# Great Framework

I'm trying to remember the good all days of the Web, when React wasn't even an idea, and WebPack was a set of shiny effects for your site built with DreamWeaver.

So I'm creating as a self-study exercise a front framework that works with vanilla JavaScript and does not need any building tool. It is based in a similar structure as React where everything is based on functions that returns a component structure based on props like JSX. It also has signals to update the DOM with precision like SolidJS, and a router that allows you to define self contained routing components.

Let's see where this take us ðŸ™‚
